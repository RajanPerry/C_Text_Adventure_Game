# C_Text_Adventure_Game
This is a text adventure game that I made in the C programming language as part of a class project. It is a game where you are trapped in a room and have to type in commands explore the room and use the object within it to escape. I am putting it in my Github to store it so I can look back on it in case I try to create another text adventure game and see my improvement.

This game is not a very good example of my coding skills. It contains many errors, including but not limited to having no comments, repeating the same code many times resulting in the code being horrifyingly longer than it should, and having very strict requirements for what commands you can type in.

This game used Visual Studio to code it.
